Java EE Security (JSR 375) upstream API and RI

Notes
-----

The API in the /api module is the *upstream API*, which means development takes place there. At set times a version of this will be synced to java.net representing "the truth". 
From java.net the API will be mirrored back to https://github.com/javaee-security-spec/spec-api

Currently Soteria is working towards an EDR1 release.
